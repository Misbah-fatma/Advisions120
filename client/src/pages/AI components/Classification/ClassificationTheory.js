                        Classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict categorical labels of new instances based on past observations. The output variable in classification is a category, such as "spam" or "not spam", "disease" or "no disease".

                      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                        Classification is used when the target variable is categorical and the goal is to categorize instances into distinct classes. Examples include spam detection, medical diagnosis, image classification, and sentiment analysis.

                        Classification aids decision-making by categorizing data into meaningful classes, automates the sorting process, and provides insights into data structure and variable relationships.

                        Popular algorithms include: <br/>
                        <li>Logistic Regression: Suitable for binary classification with linear decision boundaries.</li>
    <li>Decision Trees: Easy to interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data.</li>
    <li>Random Forest: Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.</li>
    <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective in high-dimensional spaces with clear margins of separation.</li>
    <li>Naive Bayes: Assumes feature independence and works well with small datasets.</li>
    <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Simple and intuitive, works well with small datasets.</li>
    <li>Neural Networks: Capable of handling complex non-linear relationships in the data.</li>

                        The model takes input features, learns to map these to target labels through parameter adjustment, and predicts class labels for new instances.<br/>
                        <li>Input Features: The model takes input features which are the characteristics or properties of the instances.</li>
    <li>Learning Process: The model learns to map these input features to the target labels by adjusting its parameters.</li>
    <li>Prediction: For a new instance, the model uses the learned mapping to predict the class label.</li>
